 To begin, choose the number of rounds and either customise
 the game parameters or go with the default game (where the 
 secret number will be between 1 and 100).

 Then choose how many rounds you'd like to play <enter> for 
 infinite mode.

 Your goal is to try to guess the secret number without
 running out of guesses.

  Good luck.
